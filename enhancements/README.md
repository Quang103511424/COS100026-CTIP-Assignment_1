Note: Make sure you get all the basics working first before you attempt any enhancements.  
  
 
The technologies for developing Web applications are rapidly changing. One of the key skills you will need is finding out about these techniques (from the Web) and applying them.  This assessment gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to implement features/techniques that go beyond the specified requirements above. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to discover techniques from a range of sources and apply them in a standards compliant manner.  
 
These enhancements need to be implemented within the Web pages (index.html, topic.html, quiz.html). The extra features need to enhance your website in a relevant way.  
 
On a separate Web page called enhancements.html  list and describe each enhancement you have made and how you have significantly extended the basic HTML and CSS beyond what is covered in the Lectures/Tutorials. Hyperlink from this list to where the feature is implemented in your website. If it is a CSS feature, hyperlink to an example of the html that is selected by the CSS rule. For each enhancement feature briefly explain:  
 
 how it goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment 
 what code is needed to implement the feature  
 if you have sourced your technique from a third party the source of this technique (e.g. URL) must be cited. 
 a hyperlink to where you have applied that extension in your website (this is needed so the 
marker can quickly assess your enhancements). 
 All enhancements must be able to run on the version of Firefox in the labs. Make sure you 
check this. 
 
A maximum of 2 enhancements will be assessed. Here are some examples of HTML/CSS enhancements: 

• Effective, appropriate  and innovative use of a  number of distinct  HTML elements not  covered in lectures/tutorials (e.g. Image maps) used in a way that improves the user experience of the website. 

• A number of  additional CSS properties or selectors (e.g. support for interactivity) not covered in  the  lectures/tutorials.  For  example  the  use  of  a  range  CSS3  pseudo-elements  and  classes, child or siblings combinators, attribute selectors, etc. (e.g. use the CSS3 :target selector to help us see where you have applied your enhancements.)  

• Implement  Responsive  Design  with  additional  CSS  that  presents  your  website  specifically  for mobile phone / tablet sized displays. 

• In  addition to your standard CSS, create another CSS files that re-implements and extends the style with a library/preprocessor such a Bootstrap, LESS or Sass. Demonstrate and document a number of cool features that can be implemented using the library.  
   
Discuss your proposed enhancements with your facilitator before you implement them. The number of marks you receive for an enhancement will be at the sole discretionof your marker. As a guide if the enhancement has only taken a couple of lines of code it is likely to be trivial. 

• Be relevant to / enhance the content of the website 

• Be well described (as explained above) 

• Be non-trivial.  

• Be significantly different from other features you have implemented.
